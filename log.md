# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: practicing how to best present a bunch of data from an API on a detail card using React Router and props.

**Thoughts:** I need to organize myself on paper to be more structured with how to show things, because then I spend an ungodly amount of time fixing styles and adding divs.

### Day 2: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: starting over with the fetch and making it more efficient. Trying new ways to present information on the cards and practice with styles.

**Thoughts:** today I did something I did NOT want to do. I was noticing some small hiccups in my web app and I kept patching it up. Implement sth new -> problem -> patch. I knew I needed to fix it at the root but I was dreading it... why? Bc I spent HOURS writing that chunk of code and I was holding onto it. But I made a new branch, deleted everything and started over. It took time and effort and frustration but I DID IT. It's more efficient and works like a charm and today I'm a happy developer :)

### Day 3: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: more practice with React Router to navigate from one item to the next or previous ones. Also, trying new HTML labels like <progress> and <meter> to present stats.

**Thoughts:** I found the solution to the problem I was having with routing previous and post items, but I think the code for it it's too long and sort of childish. Hopefully I can find a better solution in the future or not being so hard on myself if I made something work just with my own ideas.
