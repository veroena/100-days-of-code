# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: practicing how to best present a bunch of data from an API on a detail card using React Router and props.

**Thoughts:** I need to organize myself on paper to be more structured with how to show things, because then I spend an ungodly amount of time fixing styles and adding divs.

### Day 2: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: starting over with the fetch and making it more efficient. Trying new ways to present information on the cards and practice with styles.

**Thoughts:** today I did something I did NOT want to do. I was noticing some small hiccups in my web app and I kept patching it up. Implement sth new -> problem -> patch. I knew I needed to fix it at the root but I was dreading it... why? Bc I spent HOURS writing that chunk of code and I was holding onto it. But I made a new branch, deleted everything and started over. It took time and effort and frustration but I DID IT. It's more efficient and works like a charm and today I'm a happy developer :)

### Day 3: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: more practice with React Router to navigate from one item to the next or previous ones. Also, trying new HTML labels like <progress> and <meter> to present stats.

**Thoughts:** I found the solution to the problem I was having with routing previous and post items, but I think the code for it it's too long and sort of childish. Hopefully I can find a better solution in the future or not being so hard on myself if I made something work just with my own ideas.

### Day 4: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: properly learning how to use SVG to dive head first into D3 tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's pretty interesting and logical, I think I'm going to use this a lot or at least it'll help me understand how others have used it when I'm reading someone else's code. A bit worried about diving into d3.js tomorrow, I don't know if I'm going too fast and I'm still too much of a newbie to go there but I'm going to give it a go.

### Day 5: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: first day of learning D3, mainly how the library works. Scale, chaining methods, render... It's insanely cool.

**Thoughts:** It feels a little overwhelming and I'm still doubtful that I'm at the right level in my front end journey to be able to follow this... But so far so good in following the lesson. Curran Kelleher is an amazing speaker and it's helping a lot. It was useful to have a brief refresh of JS concepts and I think I'm understanding how things work... Next step: USING IT!
