# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: practicing how to best present a bunch of data from an API on a detail card using React Router and props.

**Thoughts:** I need to organize myself on paper to be more structured with how to show things, because then I spend an ungodly amount of time fixing styles and adding divs.
