# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: practicing how to best present a bunch of data from an API on a detail card using React Router and props.

**Thoughts:** I need to organize myself on paper to be more structured with how to show things, because then I spend an ungodly amount of time fixing styles and adding divs.

### Day 2: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: starting over with the fetch and making it more efficient. Trying new ways to present information on the cards and practice with styles.

**Thoughts:** today I did something I did NOT want to do. I was noticing some small hiccups in my web app and I kept patching it up. Implement sth new -> problem -> patch. I knew I needed to fix it at the root but I was dreading it... why? Bc I spent HOURS writing that chunk of code and I was holding onto it. But I made a new branch, deleted everything and started over. It took time and effort and frustration but I DID IT. It's more efficient and works like a charm and today I'm a happy developer :)

### Day 3: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: more practice with React Router to navigate from one item to the next or previous ones. Also, trying new HTML labels like <progress> and <meter> to present stats.

**Thoughts:** I found the solution to the problem I was having with routing previous and post items, but I think the code for it it's too long and sort of childish. Hopefully I can find a better solution in the future or not being so hard on myself if I made something work just with my own ideas.

### Day 4: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: properly learning how to use SVG to dive head first into D3 tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** It's pretty interesting and logical, I think I'm going to use this a lot or at least it'll help me understand how others have used it when I'm reading someone else's code. A bit worried about diving into d3.js tomorrow, I don't know if I'm going too fast and I'm still too much of a newbie to go there but I'm going to give it a go.

### Day 5: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: first day of learning D3, mainly how the library works. Scale, chaining methods, render... It's insanely cool.

**Thoughts:** It feels a little overwhelming and I'm still doubtful that I'm at the right level in my front end journey to be able to follow this... But so far so good in following the lesson. Curran Kelleher is an amazing speaker and it's helping a lot. It was useful to have a brief refresh of JS concepts and I think I'm understanding how things work... Next step: USING IT!

### Day 6: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: woke up with a bad fever and I didn't dare going into D3, but I fixed up some quirks in a previous project that has been in my to-do list

**Thoughts:** I love React and I want to use it everyday of my life <3

### Day 7: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: still very much sick... In fact more sick than yesterday. Can't go into d3 like this but I did a tech test and reviewed some JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Feeling quite insecure about my skills as a programmer since I don't know anything about MATH. JavaScripts algorithms are hard and it takes me hours to understand or create one... Is this something you can learn or is it innate?

**Link to work:** (review in my files and the Adalab Gitbook)

### Day 8: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  feeling a bit better so I'm back on my d3 journey! It is just... SO COOL. I truly can't wait until I'm comfortable enough with the language to start making my own projects. For now, YT and tutorials it is!

**Thoughts:** I wish I had more time to dedicate this a good chunk of the day, I think I would be able to accomplish more if I put steadier hours into this

### Day 9: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I was very busy today so no advances with d3... BUT I managed to squeeze in an hour of code to start an assignment: a mood tracker with React JS! 

**Thoughts:** It's fun and relaxing to go back to React, I love the logic of this framework, I think it works really well with how I organize things in my head.

### Day 10: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: it's late and we're going through a heat wave. I'm tired bc I was doing tech related things all day. But then I thought about an idea on the train and I opened my laptop to code the minute I got home. I'm starting a small project to celebrate Pride tomorrow :D

**Thoughts:** I love that now I have the tools to make things that appear in my head. Now they're not just ideas, they're finally things.

### Day 11: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  I didn't want to let June end without doing something for Pride so I did a small app to remember the heroes of Stonewall. 

**Thoughts:** I thought this was going to be easier than it was but I forgot that I'm not the best with transitions/animations because it takes patience. Getting better though! I think the end result looks like I imagined in my head so I'm happy :D

### Day 12: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  finished the mood tracker with React JS!

**Thoughts:** actually pretty pride of how I did the logic on this. I could have implement other things or make a better design but this is good enough for now and I need some sleep.

### Day 13-14: July 1-2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: yesterday I fell asleep without logging progress. I reviewed some Bootstrap concepts and today back to my D3, still in early stages but playing with some csv files

**Thoughts:** I'm not a massive fan of Bootstrap but I kind of see the appeal for quick production if you don't need a personalized product.

**Link to work:** (tutorials on Adalab Gitbook and D3 with the Curran Kelleher course on GitHub)

### Day 15: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  D3 practice all day today! Played around with line charts, bar charts, scatter plots... even maps! I'm starting to realize the endless possibilities of this massive library 

**Thoughts:** I finally did the tutorial I most wanted to do: the world population that shows on a map! Using the latitude and longitude as x and y coordinates... it looks INSANELY COOL.

**Link to work:** (on local since I did it following a tutorial)

### Day 16: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: more D3, trying to incorporate real data but I kind of hit a wall. I've been looking for files but the interesting ones are pretty messy and I would have to fix the csv before getting to visualization...

**Thoughts:** CSV files from open data are messy and it took a while to fix it before I could parse it as an array correctly!

**Link to work:** (on local since it's on early stages)

### Day 17: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: little bit of a setback with D3 today. Got too ambitious with the project I was doing and I just felt lost. Did some progress with csv files but back to D3 tutorials for now. 

**Thoughts:** It's hard to work with the data that interest me bc so far what I've been parsing are just arrays of numbers and the CSV files I'm finding interesting have A LOT of data, a lot of it not numbers.

### Day 18: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: was out all day being social and didn't remember my coding commitment until we were coming back home to sleep.. So I just finished my daily challenge at 2am, D3 tutorials on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm liking it so far because it starts from the very beginning and I'm understanding concepts better.

### Day 19: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did a whole lot of CSS today and then some good ol' JavaScript. I also continued with my D3 journey via @freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** Their data visualization section is GREAT for beginners but I'm skipping some parts since I feel like the give you the answer right away with the examples they show. I feel like I don't even have to think sometimes.
